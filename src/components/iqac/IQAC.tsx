          <p className='text-14'>
            Quality Assurance is a continuous process of Quality Improvement in
            Higher Education through Accreditation and Assessment. Bangladesh
            University endeavors to promote and sustain quality in all aspects
            and dimensions of learning and operations. To bring the dynamics of
            education into a high level, in 2008, a quality assurance center
            (AQAC) was established in the university. The primordial function of
            the center was to oversee and lead the quality assurance activities
            of the university through a series of building awareness and
            training of the academic and administrative personnel. In 2015, AQAC
            was transformed/restructured into an Institutional Quality Assurance
            Cell (IQAC) as per the mandate by the University Grants Commission
            of Bangladesh (UGC) - Ministry of Education (MoE).

            Quality and Accountability are two inseparable and indispensable
            actions. Quality is not given on a silver platter. It has to be
            worked out in view of its varying applications and uses. It has to
            suit and pass the test of time considering the fast and emerging
            developments, demands, and needs of the potential users. It has to
            be sustained and made accountable in the process of implementation
            and close coordination with various units of the university. It
            serves as a vanguard of quality of the university.

              Bangladesh University prioritizes quality over quantity in its
              academic programs and services. Since 2007, it has collaborated
              with global QA organizations like APQN and AIU-UNESCO to enhance
              its quality assurance framework. In 2011, its business, Computer
              Science, and EEE programs received international accreditation,
              making it the first university in Bangladesh to achieve this
              milestone. This achievement earned global recognition, with APQN
              awarding it as the Best Model QA University for Asia and the
              Pacific in 2016. Such recognition reflects the universityâ€™s
              commitment to maintaining international standards in higher
              education.
